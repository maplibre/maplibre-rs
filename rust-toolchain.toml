# This library version should match the $STABLE_TOOLCHAIN version of the justfile. The CI will not use
# the rust-toolchain.toml file to build this project. The CI might use it though to build other Rust binaries, required
# for building maplibre-rs.
# This file is here to give IDEs a hint about which Rust version to use.
