[toolchain]
# The CI will not use the rust-toolchain.toml file to build this project.
# The CI might use it though to build other Rust binaries, required for building maplibre-rs.
# This file is here to give IDEs a hint about which Rust version to use.
# The version is set here instead of using stable, so we can make sure that a predictable version is used.
#
# Keep this in sync with `justfile` and `Cargo.toml`
